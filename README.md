The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. The goal of this project is  to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help journalists(food magazine: Eat Safe, Love) and food critics decide where to focus future articles. This project has 3 parts:

### Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
### Part 2: Update the Database 
New halal restaurant just opened in Greenwich, but hasn't been rated yet. It has been included in analysis. Also, any establishments within the Dover Local Authority has been removed from the database.

### Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Food magazine: Eat Safe, Love has specific questions (which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid) and based on those questions analysis was done.
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.

Database and Jupyter Notebook Set up as well as Update of database is done in file NoSQL_setup(part1&2).ipynb

Exploratory Analysisis is done in file NoSQL_analysis(part3).ipynb
